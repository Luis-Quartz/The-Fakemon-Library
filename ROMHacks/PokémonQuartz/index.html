					<h1>Pokémon Quartz</h1>
					
					<img src="/ROMHacks/PokémonQuartz/Title.png" class="centered"></img>
					
					<p>Pokémon Quartz is a ROM Hack of Pokémon Ruby created by Baro. It was released in 2006.</p>
					
					<p>Pokémon Quartz introduced 386 Fakemon, one for each existing official Pokémon at the time of Generation III. Many of these Fakemon are direct stand-ins for official Pokémon they replace, often sharing their color palette and in some cases even keeping their design inspirations.</p>
					
					<h2>Adventure Through the Corna Region</h2>
					
					<p>Pokémon Quartz takes place in the region of Corna, where you moved from Saffron City along with your friend, Professor Baro.</p>
					<p>Corna is a region full of strange, never-before-seen Pokémon. Though the layout is the same as the original Hoenn region, every area has been redesigned and reimagined; exploring the region will be a new experience even if you know Hoenn by heart.</p>
					
					<h2>Other Features</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Completely new, original characters.</li>
						<li>Gym Leaders have had their type specialties changed, and... there are 9 Badges!</li>
						<li>Skates instead of Bikes.</li>
						<li>Catch all the Legendary Pokémon of Corna!</li>
						<li>New stories, legends, and places!</li>
					</ul>
