					<h1>PokéGods</h1>
					<p>The PokéGods are perhaps the oldest Pokémon urban legend there is, and it is also one of my favorites. This section of the library is dedicated to documenting and archiving as much information about them as possible.</p>
					<p>So, what <i>are</i> the PokéGods? And how could I obtain one?</p>
					<p>In very simple terms, they are god-like Pokémon that were supposedly hidden in the Generation 1 games and had a Pokédex number greater than 150.</p>
					<p>As for how to obtain a PokéGod, the methods varied wildly: Beat the Pokémon League a certain number of times (often with specific Pokémon); find and use the legendary Mist Stone on a fully-evolved Pokémon to evolve it into a PokéGod; access Bill's Secret Garden behind his house on Route 25; talk to a certain NPC a set number of times while having specific Pokémon in your Party in the correct order...</p>
					<p>There was virtually no limit to the creativity of the supposed methods to obtain the PokéGods, and each of them would usually take upwards of an hour to perform. And if you were not careful, some of the steps involved could endanger your save file... or even your game cartridge in the worst cases.</p>
					<p>To the younger fans, it may seem outrageous to think people could believe such rumors. But keep in mind, this all happened not only in the early days of Pokémon, but also at a time when the internet was only starting to become widespread and information was not as easy to find as it is today. And as convenient as it is to find accurate information on a variety of Pokémon fan sites, there is an element of mystery that has been lost because of it.</p>
					
					<h2>PokéGod Categories</h2>
					<p>PokéGods can be grouped into a number of categories depending on their origin. Note that some PokéGods may belong to more than one category. These are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Glitch Pokémon, most famously MissingNo.</li>
						<li>Pokémon planned for Gold and Silver.</li>
						<li>Fusions of two or more official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Pokémon or creatures appearing in official media outside the core games.
						<li>PokéGods without any clear origin.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>No matter which group they belong to, PokéGods were thought to be extremely powerful, with a few exceptions that were believed to simply be hidden "bonus" Pokémon.</p>
					<p>At this point, some of you reading this may have already picked up on something...</p>
					
					<h1>Mew</h1>
					<img src="/Main/PokéGods/Images/Mew.png" class="article-img-right"></img>
					<p>It has a number higher than 150; it has the unique ability to learn any TM; it is "hidden" within the code of the games and is obtainable by following a series of very specific actions; and perhaps most crucially, its very nature was shrouded in mystery.</p>
					<p>Indeed, Mew could be considered the original PokéGod, and it could even be said to belong to its own category: Mythical Pokémon. You probably are already familiar with the concept; very rare Pokémon species that can only be obtained through special events.</p>
					<p>Of course, Mythical Pokémon are a well-known aspect of the series today, and nowadays every generation is expected to introduce at least one of them. But at the time of Generation 1, Mew was the only Mythical Pokémon in existence, and like with pretty much every other aspect of the series back then, there was no precedent for it.</p>
					
					<h2>Mew's Role in the PokéGod Phenomenon</h2>
					
					<p>Though common knowledge today, to some Mew was just as "mysterious" as the other rumored PokéGods. With lack of official sources, and even the internet lacking much information on it, people's imaginations were left to wander. Sure, there were the Nintendo events, but a generally younger fanbase led into a lot of "what ifs" which turned into rumors and secret codes spread by word of mouth over the playground.</p>
					<p>These rumors would end up on the internet and tended to fall into a few specific archetypes. These Included:</p>
					
					<h3>Mew under the Truck</h3>
					<p>As is more or less common knowledge by now, a pickup truck can be found near the S.S. Anne if the player prevents it from leaving until Surf is obtained. This truck was the source of many rumors, the most popular being that there was some kind of way to move it, usually by using Strength. Generally, it was assumed that if one was able to move the truck, Mew could be found underneath it. This being said, the actual truck has no ingame use and could not be moved, presumably being there simply as a small easter egg for those who managed to get to the area (or even to intentionally fuel rumors...?).</p>
					
					<h3>Mew After the Elite Four</h3>
					<p>There was the assumption that Mew could be obtained by beating the Elite Four with certain requirements or a certain number of times. This was often used as a step in conjunction with other codes or methods, and the number of times required to beat them was usually extremely high, though it varied.</p>
					
					<h3>Mew Instead of the Diploma</h3>
					<p>This quite possibly could have been the longest believed "how to get Mew" rumor. Many people claimed that in the Japanese version, or in the English version (possibly with certain requirements being met), Mew would be given to the player in the place of the diploma which is awarded for completing the Pokédex. Since this was easily proven false, it was often claimed to be "only in the Japanese Blue version."</p>
					
					<p>Even though none of the codes to obtain Mew actually worked (except for the Mew glitch), there was no denying that Mew actually existed, its appearance in official media (screenshots, movies, etc.) being solid proof of this. What is interesting about this rumor is that it started the trend of claiming "It was in the Japanese version", which for some reason made sense and furthered the mystery for a lot of people. (this was echoed in real life in Crystal with the removal of the Celebi event) Along the way kids would imagine, "if Mew is real... <i>Then what ELSE?</i>" It is quite possible that the other Pokegods codes stemmed from the original "Mew codes" in this way.</p>
					
					<h1>Supposed Evolutions of Official Pokémon</h1>
					
					<h1>Glitch Pokémon</h1>
					
					<h1>Pokémon Planned for Gold and Silver</h1>
					<p>Another unprecedented happening at the time of Generation 1 was the leadup to a new Generation. This gave us pre-release artwork of Pokémon that naturally weren't in the Generation 1 games. Again, the limited information, coupled with a lack of context for said images, led to a lot of rumors on how to obtain these strange new Pokémon in the Generation 1 games.</p>
					
					<h1>Fusions</h1>
					
					<h1>Pokémon from Outside Media</h1>
					
					<h1>PokéGods with no Canon Basis</h1>
					
					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<p>Although most information regarding the PokéGods was a result of rumors being spread over the playground and early internet, there is no denying that they were an important part of what it meant to be a Pokémon fan back in the early days. And because of that, they deserve to be documented and preserved.</p>
					<p>It could even be argued that the PokéGod phenomenon actually made the series more popular than it would have been without it.</p>
					<p>There is much, much more that can be said about the PokéGods. Check the Articles section if you would like to read more on this fascinating subject.</p>
