					<h1>The PokéGods</h1>
					
					<p>The PokéGods are perhaps the oldest Pokémon urban legend there is, and it is also one of my favorites. This section of the library is dedicated to documenting and archiving as much information about them as possible.</p>
					
					<p>So, what exactly are the PokéGods? And how could I obtain one?</p>
					
					<p>In very simple terms, the PokéGods are godlike Pokémon that were supposedly hidden in the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I">Generation 1</a> games and had a Pokédex number greater than 150. Some were believed to have unique abilities.</p>
					
					<p>However, simply giving you a definition really doesn’t do them justice; they were a big part of the excitement that surrounded the Pokémon series during its early days. They gave the games a sense of mystery that seems almost impossible in today’s world where data mining and internet access are so commonplace.</p>
					
					<p>As for how to obtain one, the methods varied wildly: Beat the Pokémon League a certain number of times in a row (often requiring you to use specific Pokémon); find and use the legendary Mist Stone on a fully evolved Pokémon to evolve it into a PokéGod; access Bill's Secret Garden behind his house on Route 25; talk to a certain NPC a set number of times while having specific Pokémon in your party in the correct order...</p>
					
					<p>There was virtually no limit to the creativity of the supposed methods to obtain the PokéGods, and each of them would usually take upwards of an hour to perform. And if you were not careful, some of the steps involved could endanger your save file... or even your game cartridge in the worst cases. There were even methods that involved erasing your save file as part of the process.</p>
					
					<p>If you’re a younger Pokémon fan, it may seem outrageous to think people could believe such rumors. But keep in mind that this all happened not only in the early days of Pokémon, but also at a time when the internet was only starting to become widespread and information was not as easy to find as it is today.</p>
					
					<p>Needless to say, many fans spent hours upon hours trying to obtain the PokéGods, whether for their power or their rarity, most of the time to no avail.</p>
					
					<h2>PokéGod Categories</h2>
					
					<p>As once explained by RageCandyBar, PokéGods can be grouped into a number of categories depending on their origin, and some PokéGods may belong to more than one category. I've slightly expanded on them to account for more PokéGods.</p>
					
					<p>These categories are:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of existing Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Glitch Pokémon, most famously MissingNo.</li>
						<li>Pokémon planned for Gold and Silver.</li>
						<li>Fusions of existing Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Pokémon from outside the core games.</li>
						<li>PokéGods without any clear origin.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>No matter which category they belong to, PokéGods were thought to be extremely powerful, with a few exceptions that were believed to simply be hidden "bonus" Pokémon.</p>
					
					<p>Before we continue, there is one more category I think should be explained; this other category consists of only one Pokémon: Mew.</p>
					
					<h2>Mew</h2>
					
					<img src="/Main/PokéGods/Images/Mew.png" class="article-img-right"></img>
					
					<p>It has a Pokédex number greater than 150; it has the unique ability to learn any TM; it is hidden within the code of the games and is obtainable by following a series of specific steps; and perhaps most important of all, most aspects of it were shrouded in mystery at the time.</p>
					
					<p>Indeed, Mew could be considered the original PokéGod, and it could even be said to belong to its own category: Mythical Pokémon. You probably are already familiar with the concept; very rare Pokémon species that can only be obtained through special events.</p>
					
					<p>Of course, Mythical Pokémon are a well-known aspect of the series today, and nowadays every generation is expected to introduce at least one of them. But at the time of Generation 1, Mew was the only Mythical Pokémon in existence, and like with pretty much every other aspect of the series back then, there was no precedent for it.</p>
					
					<h3>Mew’s Role in the PokéGod Phenomenon</h3>
					
					<p>As you can imagine, Mew provided all the perfect conditions for many rumors to be created about it, and from there, people’s imaginations went wild. After all, if Mew was real, what else could be out there waiting to be discovered?</p>
					
					<p>These rumors would end up on the internet and tended to fall into a few specific archetypes. These included:</p>
					
					<h4>Mew under the Truck</h4>
					
					<p>As is more or less common knowledge by now, a pickup truck can be found near the S.S. Anne if the player prevents it from leaving until Surf is obtained. This truck was the source of many rumors, the most popular being that there was some kind of way to move it, usually by using Strength. Generally, it was assumed that if one was able to move the truck, Mew could be found underneath it.</p>
					
					<p>This being said, the actual truck has no in-game use and cannot be moved, presumably being there simply as a small Easter egg for those who managed to get to the area (or even to intentionally fuel rumors...?).</p>
					
					<h4>Mew After the Elite Four</h4>
					
					<p>There was the assumption that Mew could be obtained by beating the Elite Four with certain requirements or a certain number of times. This was often used as a step in conjunction with other codes or methods, and the number of times required to beat them was usually extremely high, though it varied.</p>
					
					<h4>Mew Instead of the Diploma</h4>
					
					<p>This quite possibly could have been the longest-standing "how to get Mew" rumor. Many people claimed that in the Japanese release, or sometimes in the English release (possibly with certain requirements being met), Mew would be given to the player in place of the diploma which is awarded for completing the Pokédex. Since this was easily proven false, it was often claimed to be "only in the Japanese release."</p>
					
					<p>Even though none of the codes to obtain Mew actually worked (except for the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a>), there was no denying that Mew actually existed, its appearance in official media (screenshots, movies, etc.) being solid proof of this.</p>
					
					<p>What is interesting about this rumor is that it started the trend of claiming that something was "only in the Japanese release," which for some reason made sense and furthered the mystery for a lot of people. This was echoed in real life with the release of Pokémon Crystal, when the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ilex_Forest_shrine#Generation_II">Celebi event</a> that took place at Ilex Forest was removed from the international releases.</p>
