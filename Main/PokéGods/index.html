					<h1>PokéGods</h1>

					<p>The PokéGods are perhaps the oldest Pokémon urban legend there is, and it is also one of my favorites. This section of the library is dedicated to documenting and archiving as many of these myths and rumors as possible.</p>
					<p>So, what <i>are</i> the PokéGods?</p>
					<img src="/Main/PokéGods/Images/PikabluTest.gif" class="article-img-right"></img>
					<p>In very simple terms, they are supposedly god-like Pokémon that were allegedly hidden in the Generation 1 games and had a Pokédex number greater than 150.</p>
					<p>PokéGods can be categorized into five categories depending on their origin. Note that some PokéGods may belong to more than one group. These categories are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Glitch Pokémon, most famously MissingNo.</li>
						<li>Pokémon planned for Gold and Silver.</li>
						<li>Fusions of two or more official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>PokéGods without any clear origin.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>No matter which group they belong to, they were almost always thought to be extremely powerful. There were some exceptions, meaning some PokéGods were thought to simply be hidden "bonus" Pokémon.</p>
					<p>Now, some of you reading this may have already picked up on something...</p>
					
					<h1>Mew</h1>
					<p>It has a number higher than 150; it has an ability that no other Pokémon does, being able to learn any TM; it is "hidden" within the code of the games and is obtaineble by performing a glitch that involves following a series of very specific actions; and perhaps most crucially, its very nature was shrouded in mystery.</p>
					<p>Yes, Mew could be considered the original PokéGod, and it could even be said to belong to its own category: Mythical Pokémon. You probably are already familiar with the concept; very rare Pokémon species that can only be obtained through special events. Of course, Mythical Pokémon are a well-known aspect of the series today, and nowadays every generation is expected to bring us at least one of them, but at the time of Generation 1, Mew was the only Mythical Pokémon in existence, and like with pretty much every other aspect of the series back then, there was no precedent for it.</p>
