					<p>The PokéGods are perhaps the oldest Pokémon urban legend there is, and it is also one of my favorites. This section of the library is dedicated to documenting and archiving as many of these myths and rumors as possible.</p>
					<p>So, what <i>are</i> the PokéGods?</p>
					<img src="/Main/PokéGods/Images/PikabluTest.gif" class="article-img-right"></img>
					<p>In very simple terms, they are supposedly god-like Pokémon that were allegedly hidden in Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow that had a Pokédex number greater than 150.</p>
					<p>PokéGods could be categorized depending on their origin:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Glitch Pokémon, most famously MissingNo.</li>
						<li>Pokémon planned for Gold and Silver</li>
						<li>Fusions of two or more official Pokémon</li>
						<li>PokéGods without any clear origin</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Note that a PokéGod could belong to more than one of these groups, and no matter which group they belonged to, they were almost always thought to be extremely powerful.</p>
