					<h1>PokéGods</h1>
					<img src="/Main/PokéGods/Images/Charcolt.png" class="article-img-right"></img>
					<p>The PokéGods are perhaps the oldest Pokémon urban legend there is, and it is also one of my favorites. This section of the library is dedicated to documenting and archiving as many of these myths and rumors as possible.</p>
					<p>So, what <i>are</i> the PokéGods? And how could I obtain one?</p>
					<p>In very simple terms, they are god-like Pokémon that were supposedly hidden in the Generation 1 games and had a Pokédex number greater than 150.</p>
					<p>As for how to obtain a PokéGod, the methods varied wildly: Beat the Pokémon League a certain number of times (often with specific Pokémon); find and use the legendary Mist Stone on a fully-evolved Pokémon to evolve it into a PokéGod; access Bill's Secret Garden behind his house on Route 25; talk to a certain NPC a set number of times while having specific Pokémon in your Party in the correct order...</p>
					<p>There was virtually no limit to the creativity of the supposed methods to obtain the PokéGods, and each of them would usually take upwards of an hour to perform. And if you were not careful, some of the steps involved could endanger your save file... or even your game cartridge in the worst cases.</p>
					
					<h2>PokéGod Categories</h2>
					<p>PokéGods can be categorized into five categories depending on their origin. Note that some PokéGods may belong to more than one group. These categories are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>Glitch Pokémon, most famously MissingNo.</li>
						<li>Pokémon planned for Gold and Silver.</li>
						<li>Fusions of two or more official Pokémon.</li>
						<li>PokéGods without any clear origin.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>No matter which group they belong to, PokéGods were thought to be extremely powerful, with a few exceptions that were believed to simply be hidden "bonus" Pokémon.</p>
					
					<p>Now, some of you reading this may have already picked up on something...</p>
					
					<h1>Mew</h1>
					<p>It has a number higher than 150; it has an ability that no other Pokémon does, being able to learn any TM; it is "hidden" within the code of the games and is obtainable by performing a glitch that involves following a series of very specific actions; and perhaps most crucially, its very nature was shrouded in mystery.</p>
					<p>Yes, Mew could be considered the original PokéGod, and it could even be said to belong to its own category: Mythical Pokémon. You probably are already familiar with the concept; very rare Pokémon species that can only be obtained through special events.</p>
					<p>Of course, Mythical Pokémon are a well-known aspect of the series today, and nowadays every generation is expected to introduce at least one of them. But at the time of Generation 1, Mew was the only Mythical Pokémon in existence, and like with pretty much every other aspect of the series back then, there was no precedent for it.</p>
