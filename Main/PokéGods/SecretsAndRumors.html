					<h1>The PokéGods: Secrets and Rumors</h1>
					<p>The early days of Pokemon's popularity have come and gone. The Red and Blue versions have now been analyzed down to their programming code and brought us to a point where there isn't much that we don't know about how they work. Some people may not realize it, but there was a time when this level of extreme understanding and access to information was not possible.</p>
					<p>When the Red and Blue versions were first released, the world was a much different place. The Internet was young and unutilized for the masses, and as of yet unable to share the information it does now. ROM hacking was virtually an unknown niche hobby, with many not even taking into consideration the programming that went into the inner-workings of a game. Pokemon itself had not yet reached the popularity it would for anyone to even consider diving into the game's coding in search of its secrets. With this environment in mind, speculation easily arose about what might lay hidden just beyond the borders of the games' set boundaries. What exactly was there, just out of reach, in places that seemed to hold so much promise? What Pokemon may exist beyond the official 150? Perhaps there were secret Pokemon, some more powerful than any encountered in the main game and so rare that almost no one knew of them. Maybe there were Pokemon that even the creators didn't want fans to know about, removed during production or only accessible in the exotic "Japanese version".</p>
					<p>This type of speculation dominated the fan community's attention for a long while, with debates raging on just what was true and what was not. Theories and "evidence" abounded, with no one ever being quite sure what to believe. Most importantly out of all of this, did these "PokeGods" exist, and where could I catch one?</p>
					<p>Nowadays it seems that if anyone mentions the "PokeGods" they get laughed off as a troll, or ranted at about how anyone that believed in them was gullible or naive. Many of the early web sites discussing the PokeGods have long been abandoned or disappeared along with their host as the owners either learned more or simply stopped caring about Pokemon. Of those that survived to become the "big name" sites frequented today, the PokeGods are an untouchable topic. They are simply ignored, or if they are mentioned, it is only briefly. Because of this, when the newer generation of fans hear about these so-called "PokeGods" and go in search of information, they are only met with sites that haven't been updated in over 10 years and those that react negatively and provide misinformation.</p>
					<p>It seems as though many Pokemon fans today want to just shrug off the early days of when everything was mysterious and Gold and Silver were just around the corner. However, to those at the RAGECANDYBAR, the whole "PokeGods" craze was an important part of the Pokemon fandom that shouldn't simply be forgotten. We have decided to salvage and archive some of the old codes and rumors and finally examine them from a more serious perspective. The origins and spread of these early beliefs have been lost for too long, and if they aren't examined now, they could be forgotten forever. This project aims to finally clear up the mystery that has accumulated over the years and provide a definitive repository of information for anyone to access, whether for nostalgia or research of their own.</p>
					
					<h1>What are the PokéGods?</h1>
					<p>The PokeGods are (or were) as their name implies, supposedly god-like Pokemon that could find their origin in one of four different categories, though they were often combined or overlapped.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supposed evolutions of Pokemon that already existed</li>
						<li>Misnamed MissingNo.-like glitch Pokemon</li>
						<li>Pokemon planned for the Gold and Silver versions (or any species above 150)</li>
						<li>Seemingly fabricated or just random</li>
					</ul>
					<p>No matter which group a particular "PokeGod" fell into, almost all of them were claimed to be ridiculously powerful. It was commonly believed that if you managed to obtain one, having it "faint" in battle would result in its actual death (meaning it would die and you could never use it again). For this reason, it was often warned never to use one PokeGod against another due to the risk.</p>
					<p>The rumors and codes circulated to obtain such PokeGods were often ridiculously extreme or convoluted in such a way that it would take a person hours to perform and test out on their own. Due to the vagueness of these codes, one could never be entirely sure if they performed a code "correctly", which often times only lent towards a code's perceived truth, since if it was so difficult to perform, many people assumed they might actually be true. Another contributing factor to the difficulty in testing was that some codes would claim to only work if the player had never used any form of cheat device on their game. This cut out a large percentage of the fanbase from even attempting to prove or disprove them as code devices were widely in use.</p>
					<p>The PokeGods seem to have appeared in three main waves, each triggered by different reasons and met with a different reaction by the fans.</p>
					<p>The first wave was triggered largely by early beta and pre-release artwork for the Gold and Silver versions released in Japan, mostly from the Spaceworld game trade show. This art and sparsely translated information on the upcoming games was found by American fans while Gold and Silver were still in production and mostly unknown to the rest of the world (having been mentioned only very briefly in a Nintendo Power issue dating before the Red/Blue versions were even announced). In an effort to understand and explain this artwork, the concept of the PokeGods was born. Most of the PokeGods and their rumors at this time spread by word-of-mouth, later finding its way onto the Internet and spreading even further.</p>
					<p>The second wave began due to the release of later pre-release artwork and information for Gold and Silver, this time directed at English-speaking audiences, as well as the appearances of new Pokemon in the second movie, Revelation Lugia (titled "The Power of One" in America). While this new information helped further some of the older rumors and establish several PokeGods, it also was the start of the end for the PokeGod phenomenon. At this time many people had been playing the Red and Blue versions for nearly two years, and information was readily-available that showed them just what Gold and Silver was. The new Pokemon, rather than being believed to be in the current games, were accurately believed to appear in the upcoming games. Because of all this, only a few of the new Pokemon were rumored as PokeGods, and even then the methods for obtaining them were limited.</p>
					<p>The third and final wave of PokeGods appeared just before or after the release of the Gold and Silver versions. Most of these PokeGods were found only on compiled lists, and unlike previous PokeGods, many seem to have been entirely fabricated (as opposed to being derived from pre-existing official artworks). Some sources indicate a few may be fan-given names for Gold and Silver Pokemon, though not enough are available for cross-reference.</p>
					<p>How exactly did all this start though? Though the pre-release and beta artwork for Gold and Silver would seem to be the dominating factor, the exact beginnings of the PokeGod phenomenon can actually be found in a much more official source: Mew.</p>
					<h2>Mew</h2>
					<p>Mew seems to be the original "Pokegod". The secret, super-powerful Pokemon that held a number greater than 150. Though common knowledge today, to some Mew was just as "mysterious" as the other rumored Pokegods. With lack of official sources, and even the Internet lacking much information on it, people's imaginations were left to wander. Sure, there were the Nintendo contests, but a generally younger fanbase led into a lot of "what if's" which turned into rumors and secret codes spread by word of mouth over the playground.</p>
					<p>These rumors would end up on the Internet and tended to fall into a few specific archetypes. These Included:</p>
					<h3>Mew under the truck</h3>
					<p>As is more or less common knowledge by now, a pickup truck can be found near the SS Anne if the player prevents it from leaving until Surf is obtained. This truck was the source of many rumors, the most popular being that there was some kind of way to move it, usually by using Strength. Generally, it was assumed that if one was able to move the truck, Mew could be found underneath it. This being said, the actual truck has no ingame use and could not be moved, presumably being there simply as a small easter egg for those who managed to get to the area (or even to intentionally fuel rumors..?)</p>
					<h3>Mew after the Elite Four</h3>
					<p>The assumption that Mew could be obtained by beating the Elite Four with certain requirements or a certain number of times. This was often used as a step in conjunction with other codes or methods, and the number of times required to beat them was usually extremely high, though it varied.</p>
					<h3>Mew instead of the Diploma</h3>
					<p>This quite possibly could have been the longest believed "how to get Mew" rumor. Many people claimed that in the Japanese version, or in the English version (possibly with certain requirements being met), that Mew would be given to the player in the place of the diploma which is awarded for completing the Pokedex. Since this was easily proven false, it was often claimed to be "only in the Japanese Blue version"</p>
					<p>Even though none of the rumors actually worked, there was no denying that Mew actually existed, its appearance in official media (screenshots, movies, etc) being solid proof of this. What is interesting about this rumor is that it started the trend of claiming "It was in the Japanese version", which for some reason made sense and furthered the mystery for a lot of people. (this was echoed in real life in Crystal with the removal of the Celebi event) Along the way kids would imagine, "if Mew is real..then what ELSE?" It is quite possible that the other Pokegods codes stemmed from the original 'Mew codes' in this way.</p>
