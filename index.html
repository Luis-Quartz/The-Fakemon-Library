					<h1>Welcome!</h1>
					<p>The Fakemon Library is a project that aims to document and classify as many Fakemon as possible while maintaining consistent quality and presentation. This includes cataloging new Pokémon forms, such as Unown symbols, Rotom devices, Mega Evolutions, regional variants, etc.</p>
					<p>"Fakemon" simply refers to Pokémon created by fans, and they can come from many different sources: ROM hacks, fan games, art galleries, and more. Each fan project that contains Fakemon or new Pokémon forms has its own Pokédex in the library.</p>
					<p>If you notice any errors or outdated info, know of a project you’d like me to cover, or simply have any questions or comments, you can <a href="mailto:luisquartz@fakemonlibrary.org?subject=Feedback on The Fakemon Library">contact me here</a>.</p>
