					<h1>Welcome to The Fakemon Library!</h1>
					<p>The Fakemon Library is a project that aims to document and classify as many Fakemon as possible while maintaining consistent quality and presentation.</p>
					<p>"Fakemon" simply refers to Pokémon created by fans of the series, and they can be found in a variety of places: ROM hacks, fan games, art galleries, etc. Each project that contains Fakemon has its own Pokédex.</p>
					<p>I do my best to correctly record all Pokédex data. That said, I'm not perfect and mistakes can happen. If you notice any errors and would like to submit a correction, or simply have any questions or comments, you can <a href="mailto:luisquartz@fakemonlibrary.org">contact me here</a>.</p>
					<p>You can download PDF versions of the Pokédexes found here over at <a href="https://issuu.com/luisquartz">my Issuu page</a>.</p>
					<p>Lastly, if you wish, you may <a href="https://patreon.com/luisquartz">support me on Patreon</a>.</p>

						<p>I'm currently setting everything up. I'll start adding game and Pokédex pages as soon as possible. For now, I've added the first game page: <a href="/ROMHacks/PokémonQuartz/index.html">Pokémon Quartz</a>.</p>
